# go-bnet

go-bnet is a Go client library for accessing the
[Battle.net API](https://dev.battle.net). In addition to providing an API
client, this package provides OAuth endpoints.

**Documentation:** [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/mitchellh/go-bnet?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/mitchellh/go-bnet)

**Build Status:** [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mitchellh/go-bnet.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mitchellh/go-bnet)

**API Coverage:** Currently only the account and profile information APIs are implemented.
However, the base helpers are there to easily and quickly implement any other
APIs such as the WoW or SC2 data.

## Usage

```go
import "github.com/mitchellh/go-bnet"
```

### Authentication

Authenticate using the [Go OAuth2](https://golang.org/x/oauth2) library.
Endpoints are provided via the `Endpoint` function. A guide to using OAuth2
to authenticate [is available in this blog post](https://blog.kowalczyk.info/article/f/Accessing-GitHub-API-from-Go.html).
The blog post uses GitHub as an example but it is almost identical for
Battle.net and this library.

Battle.net endpoints are region-specific, so specify the region to the
`Endpoint` function and use the resulting value. Example:

```go
oauthCfg := &oauth2.Config{
    // Get from dev.battle.net
    ClientID:     "",
    ClientSecret: "",

    // Endpoint from this library
    Endpoint: bnet.Endpoint("us"),
}
```

Once you have access to the OAuth client, you can import and initilize one of the Battle.net
API clients:

```go
// Token from prior auth
authClient := oauthCfg.Client(oauth2.NoContext, token)

// Initialize the Battle.net Profile API client
client := profile.NewClient("us", authClient)

// ... API calls
```

### API Calls

Once a client is made, basic API calls can easliy be made:

```go
user, resp, err := client.Account().User()
fmt.Printf("User: %#v", user)
```

All API calls return a `*Response` value in addition to a richer type
and error. The response contains the http.Response as well as metadata
such as quotas, QPS, etc. from Battle.net
